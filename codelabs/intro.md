# Intro


# Multipaz

This repository contains libraries and applications for working with real-world
identity. The initial focus for this work was mdoc/mDL according to [ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021](https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html)
and related standards but the current scope also include other credential formats and
presentment protocols.

## Utopia Wholesale App 

This codelab includes the Utopia Wholesale App, a demo application that showcases how to use the identity-credential project and its Multipaz APIs to implement a complete digital identity flow — including credential issuance, secure storage, presentation, and verification.

This guide is designed for developers who want to:
- Understand the end-to-end flow of verifiable credentials using the OpenWallet Foundation standards.
- Learn how to integrate the Multipaz APIs into their own mobile or cross-platform apps (Kotlin Multiplatform / Compose Multiplatform).
- Explore how identity data can be issued by a trusted source, stored securely on-device, and presented to verifiers in a privacy-preserving way.

By following this Utopia example, you’ll get a hands-on look at how to build real-world identity experiences using the identity-credential toolkit.
